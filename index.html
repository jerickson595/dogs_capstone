      <h2 id="titledogs">Milo and Touya</h2>
      <p>My two dogs are the sweetest. Milo is a 13 1/2 year old pure german rottweiller - he's our alpha.  Touya is a 4 year old shepard-rottie mix(also refered to as a belanoir) - she's our beta.  Well they think they are but <strong>we</strong> are actually <em>the alpha and beta.</em></p></section>

        <h2>What I learned from raising my Dogs</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Socializing:  At the beginning we introduced Milo and Touya to immediate family only; this was to teach them who family is and to build trust. At 3-4 months we started to introduce them to friends, extended family, strangers, other dogs/cats and children (there are several daycares close by).  I introduced the children as little people and to be gentle.</li>
        <li>Exercise:  This is so important because both dogs are high energy.  So we walk and run them 3 times daily.  In the summer months we take them to Onion Lake and throw the ball/stick into the water (they love to swim).  A chuck-it is perfect for them when walking or swimming. Hiking is one of our favorite activity with the dogs at our heels.</li>
        <li>Training:  This starts as soon as you get the dog.  Establish a home space where your dogs are to sleep, potty, and eat.  "No" is used often in the beginning but be careful when you use that word.  If you catch them in the act then they learn what is expected of them; if not, they have no idea what they did or why you are mad at them.  Visually showing them works in these cases.To avoid teething issues (torn up slippers, shoes or furniture) buy a good quality chew toy.  They will chew things up if left for long periods of time (remember they need your companionship).  Dogs are highly intelligient and want to learn on a daily basis.  It is important to discipline your dog consistently, patiently and firmly.  We avoided the rough stuff while they were young because it breeds aggression.</li>
        <li>Grooming:  Milo and Touya get brushed frequetly due to their thick fur and undercoat. Yes, we sweep the floor, and vaccum the rugs and furniture daily. We found that deer antlers were the best to keep their teeth healthy and strong.  Find a quality toe nail trimmer and try not to clip through the quick;  the quick is the soft cuticle at the base of the dog's nail that contains nerves and blood vessels that nourish the nail. Bathing, we try to do this at least every 2-3 weeks.  Lol, good luck with this, I usually use shorts when doing this.</li>
        <li>My dogs Health:  Milo has -Touya will- develope hip and elbow dysplasia.  We give Milo Omega-3's to help with pain and our chiropractor comes over once a month to adjust him - Milo shows his love after every visit.  Both dogs have a life expectancy of 8-10 years.  Milo has surpassed this he is 13 1/2 yrs old.  Touya is only 4 yrs old.</li>
        <li>Feeding:  Check ingredients label please.  So many commercially made dog foods have fillers in them - we watch out for any corn or wheat fillers.  Meat products should be the first ingredient not meat by-products.  A good list of vegetables and fruit is a must on a label.  We spend a lot of money on the high-quality dog foods according to age requirements.</li></ul>

        <h2>Fun facts about Dogs:</h2>
        <ol>
         <li>Dogs poop in alignment with the earth's magnetic field</li>
        <li>Contrary to the belief that dogs evolved from wolves, they actually share a common ancestor.  This indicates that Dogs and Modern Grey Wolves are more like sister species.</li>
        <li>Dogs can be trained to detect cancer in humans.</li>
        <li>In Ancient Rome, Mastiffs wore armour and were used to attack knights.</li>
        <li>Dogs are naturally submissive to any creature with a higher pack status.  IE: your cat.</li>
        <li>Dogs have three eyelids.  The third eyelid called a "haw" is used to help keep the eye lubricated.</li>
        <li>A Blood Hound is so good at following scent trails that their "trailing" results can be used as evidence in a court of law. </li>
        <li>Germany was the first country to train seeing eye dogs after WW1 as a way of helping blind veterans.</li>
        <li>Dogs curl up into a ball when sleeping to protect their vital organs and stay warm.  This is a trait leftover from their wolfen ancestry.</li>
        <li>Dogs have better low-light vision for two reasons. They have more light-sensitive rods in their eyes than color-detecting ones and their pupils are larger which allows more light into the eye.</li>
